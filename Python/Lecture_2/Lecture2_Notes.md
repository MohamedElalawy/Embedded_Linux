# **`pip`** in Python:

---

### üìå **What is `pip`?**

**`pip`** stands for **‚ÄúPip Installs Packages‚Äù** (it‚Äôs a recursive acronym).
It‚Äôs the **standard package manager** for Python.
You use `pip` to **install**, **upgrade**, and **uninstall** **Python packages** from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How to check if you have `pip` installed**

Open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:

```bash
pip --version
```

or sometimes:

```bash
python -m pip --version
```

### üöÄ **Basic `pip` commands**

| Action                       | Command                              | Example                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |

### üìç **Where does `pip` install packages?**

By default, it installs to the **Python environment** you‚Äôre using ‚Äî
either the **system Python**, a **virtual environment** (`venv`), or a **conda environment**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Best practice**

When working on projects, it‚Äôs good practice to use a **virtual environment**
to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
pip install <package>
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c79f675-c2e7-4b9d-b9d7-ffe3e0c79a5c)

---


---

## ‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ How to set up a **virtual environment** (`venv`)

### üìå **Step 1: Create the `venv`**

In your project folder, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

* `python` ‚Äî runs Python.
* `-m venv` ‚Äî calls the built-in module to create a virtual environment.
* `venv` ‚Äî the name of the folder that will hold the virtual environment (you can name it anything, but `venv` is common).

---

### üìå **Step 2: Activate the `venv`**

**‚û°Ô∏è On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f32d3444-74fe-4aa5-8ef6-37d6deff0467)


---

You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs active because your terminal prompt will change:

```bash
(venv) $
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/533ce4fd-27ac-4e46-a130-d590969a9aef)

 **To deactivate (exit) your `venv`:**

Just run:

```bash
deactivate
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a61d3237-6b70-4a97-ae60-bc4c278e78bd)


---

### üìå **Step 3: Install packages in your `venv`**

Once activated, install any packages:

```bash
pip install requests flask
```

Packages will now install **inside the `venv`**, not globally.

---

## ‚úÖ 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to create a `requirements.txt`

A `requirements.txt` file **lists all the packages** your project needs ‚Äî so you (or someone else) can recreate the same environment.

---

### üìå **Step 1: Install your packages**

While your `venv` is active:

```bash
pip install <your-packages>
```

---

### üìå **Step 2: Generate `requirements.txt`**

Run:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This writes all installed packages **and their versions** into `requirements.txt`.

Example:

```
flask==3.0.2
requests==2.31.0
```

---

### üìå **Step 3: Install from `requirements.txt` later**

To recreate the same environment on another machine:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

**`apt-cache show <package>`** ‚Äî displays detailed information about a Debian/Ubuntu package, like version, description, dependencies, and maintainer.
**Example:** `apt-cache show python3-pip` shows info about the `python3-pip` package.

# **Python Package Installation Methods:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95dd140c-0b3c-457a-8c34-49d4857a8e05)


1. **apt (Recommended for System Packages)**
   - Command: `sudo apt install python3-<package>`
   - Pros:
     * Fully integrated with system updates
     * Dependency-safe (won't break system tools)
     * Managed by Debian/Ubuntu
   - Cons:
     * Often older versions
     * Limited selection
   - Best for: Core dependencies like `python3-dev`, `python3-venv`

2. **pip in Virtual Environments (Recommended for Projects)**
   - Setup:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install: `pip install <package>`
   - Pros:
     * Latest package versions
     * Full PyPI ecosystem access
     * Isolated from system
   - Best for: Project-specific packages (Flask, Django, etc.)

3. **pipx (For Global Tools)**
   - Setup: `sudo apt install pipx`
   - Install: `pipx install <package>`
   - Pros:
     * Isolated installations
     * Safe for global CLI tools
   - Best for: Applications like `black`, `poetry`, `youtube-dl`

4. **System-wide pip (Not Recommended)**
   - Blocked by default (PEP 668)
   - Risky alternatives:
     ```bash
     pip install --user <package>  # May still cause conflicts
     pip install --break-system-packages <package>  # Dangerous
     ```

**Key Differences:**
- Stability: `apt` > `pipx` > `pip`
- Freshness: `pip` > `pipx` > `apt`

# When you have **multiple Python versions**, you must be careful **which `pip` you‚Äôre using**, because each Python version has its own `pip`.

---

###  **Key idea**

* **`pip`** installs packages for **the Python version it‚Äôs linked to**.
* You can easily end up with:

  * `pip3` ‚Üí for Python 3
  * `pip3.10`, `pip3.11`, etc. ‚Üí for specific Python 3 versions
* Or you might be using a **virtual environment**, which has its own `pip`.

---

###  **How to check**

**1Ô∏è Check which `pip` you‚Äôre using**

```bash
which pip
which pip3
which pip3.11
```

---

**2Ô∏è Check which Python version it‚Äôs tied to**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4609e6b1-b3ff-484e-88a9-6a9a7fdc4629)

```bash
pip --version
```
---

** Safer way: use `python -m pip`**

The best practice is to use:

```bash
python3.11 -m pip install somepackage
```

 This guarantees that `pip` is run by **that Python interpreter**, so you know exactly where the package will go.

---

###  **Common mistake**

Installing with `sudo pip` to the system Python can break things ‚Äî especially if your OS uses that Python for system tools.
**Safer:** Use a `venv` or `--user`.

#  **module**, **package**, and **binary** :

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Module

* **What is it?**
  A **module** is **a single Python file** (`.py`) that contains Python code ‚Äî variables, functions, classes.
* **Example:**

  ```python
  # my_module.py
  def say_hello():
      print("Hello")
  ```

  You can import it:

  ```python
  import my_module
  my_module.say_hello()
  ```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Package

* **What is it?**
  A **package** is a **folder** that contains a special `__init__.py` file (can be empty) plus **one or more modules or sub-packages**.
  This makes it possible to structure larger projects.
* **Example:**

  ```
  my_package/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module1.py
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ module2.py
  ```

  Usage:

  ```python
  import my_package.module1
  ```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Binary

* **What is it?**
  A **binary** is a **compiled file** ‚Äî it‚Äôs not Python source code but an executable program or compiled library (`.exe`, `.so`, `.dll`, `.bin`).
  In Python projects, you might have binaries as **compiled C extensions** or **executables installed by pip**.
* **Example:**

  * When you install `numpy`, parts of it are compiled C binaries for speed.
  * The `pip` command itself is a small binary wrapper that runs Python code.

---

# **the main use cases of `venv`**:

---

## ‚úÖ **Main use cases of `venv`**

1. **Isolate project dependencies**

   * Keep each project‚Äôs Python packages separate.
   * Example: Project A needs `Django 2.2`, Project B needs `Django 4.2`.

2. **Avoid messing up system Python**

   * You don‚Äôt install packages globally.
   * No risk of breaking system tools that rely on the default Python.

3. **Reproducible environments**

   * You can freeze your dependencies (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`) and recreate the exact same environment on another machine.

4. **Test with different versions**

   * Easily create multiple virtual environments with different Python versions to test compatibility.

5. **Safe experimentation**

   * Try new libraries or tools without risk.
   * If something breaks, just delete the venv.

---

#  What is **`uv`**?

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a **fast Python package manager** ‚Äî it‚Äôs an **alternative to `pip`**, `virtualenv`, and `pip-tools` ‚Äî **all in one**.
It‚Äôs written in Rust for high performance.

**Key features:**

* Creates virtual environments (like `venv`)
* Installs packages (like `pip`)
* Resolves and locks dependencies (like `pip-tools` or `poetry`)
* Extremely fast because it‚Äôs compiled in Rust.

---

##  **Why is `uv` considered better than `pip` (in some cases)?**

| Aspect                    | `pip`                                        | `uv`                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**                 | Pure Python ‚Üí slower                         | Rust ‚Üí much faster installs & dependency resolution   |
| **Dependency resolution** | `pip` resolves on the fly                    | `uv` uses a modern, robust resolver ‚Äî fewer conflicts |
| **Lock files**            | Needs `pip-tools` or `poetry` for lock files | Built-in `uv pip compile` ‚Üí simple locking            |
| **Virtual environments**  | Use `venv` or `virtualenv` separately        | `uv` can create & manage envs directly                |
| **Modern UX**             | `pip` is basic                               | `uv` has modern CLI design, helpful output            |

---

##  When to use **`uv`**

* You want faster installs for big projects.
* You want modern dependency resolution (reliable lock files).
* You like having `pip`, `venv`, and `pip-tools` features in **one tool**.
* You want a modern toolchain similar to what `poetry` or `hatch` offer, but faster.

---

##  When `pip` is fine

* You need the default, standard tool that works everywhere.
* You want minimal extra tools for simple scripts.
* You work in an environment where `uv` is not available yet.

---

##  Bottom line

**`pip`** is the official, standard package manager ‚Äî always available.
**`uv`** is a **modern, super-fast** alternative ‚Äî great for local dev if you want speed and built-in lock files.

# Built-in Functions vs Object Methods:

**Built-in Functions**

* **Example:** `len(name)`
* `len()` is a **built-in function** ‚Äî it‚Äôs part of Python‚Äôs global functions that work on many types (strings, lists, tuples, etc.).
* You pass an **object** (like `name`) as an argument to the function.
* So `len(name)` returns the length of `name`.

üîπ **General-purpose:** Works on different object types, not tied to a single type.

---

**Object Methods**

* **Example:** `name.lower()`
* `.lower()` is a **method** ‚Äî a function that **belongs to a specific object** type (in this case, strings).
* You call it **directly on the object**: `name.lower()`.
* This converts the string to lowercase.

üîπ **Specific-purpose:** Tied to the object‚Äôs type ‚Äî `lower()` works only for strings.

---

‚úÖ **Key difference:**

* **Built-in functions:** `len()`, `print()`, `type()`, etc. ‚Äî called independently.
* **Object methods:** `.lower()`, `.append()`, `.split()` ‚Äî called *on* the object.

It‚Äôs used to:

* Read documentation about functions, modules, classes, methods, etc.
* Quickly check what something does.
* Explore available attributes and methods.

---

## ‚úÖ How to use `help`

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Get help for a built-in function**

```py
help(len)
```

‚Üí Shows help for the `len()` function.

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Get help for a module**

```py
import os
help(os)
```

‚Üí Shows help for the entire `os` module.

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Get help for a specific method**

```py
name = "Elalawy"
help(name.lower)
```

‚Üí Shows help for the `.lower()` string method.

---

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Enter the interactive help system**
Just type:

```py
help()
```

Then you get an interactive prompt:

```
help> modules
```

or:

```
help> keywords
```

Exit with `quit`.

## ‚úÖ Example

```py
>>> help(str)
```

Gives you all documentation about the `str` class and its methods.

# **Special Methods** in Python

* Special methods (also called **dunder methods** ‚Äî short for *Double UNDERSCORE*) are **built-in hooks** that you define inside a class.
* Their names start and end with double underscores: `__like_this__`.
* Python uses them to give your objects special behaviors, like how they should be printed, compared, added, etc.

---

## üîë Common examples:

| Special Method | Purpose                                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__init__`     | Called when you create a new object (the constructor).                            |
| `__str__`      | Defines what `print(object)` shows.                                               |
| `__repr__`     | Defines the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù string representation (used in the REPL, logs, debugging). |
| `__len__`      | Called when you use `len(object)`.                                                |
| `__add__`      | Defines what happens when you do `object1 + object2`.                             |
| `__eq__`       | Defines behavior for `==` comparisons.                                            |

## ‚úÖ Example:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title

    def __str__(self):
        return f"The book title is '{self.title}'"

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.title)

my_book = Book("Python Basics")
print(my_book)       # Uses __str__
print(len(my_book))  # Uses __len__
```

**Output:**

```
The book title is 'Python Basics'
13
```

# `dir()` in Python

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bee1f214-7c30-4151-b456-3b18f5a600ad)


* `dir()` is a **built-in function**.
* It returns a **list of all attributes** and **methods** that belong to an object.
* It‚Äôs very useful for exploring what you can do with a module, class, or variable.

---

##  How to use `dir()`

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Check what‚Äôs in the current scope:**

```python
dir()
```

This shows all names defined in your current script or session.

---

** See attributes/methods of an object:**

```python
name = "Python"
print(dir(name))
```

You‚Äôll see a list like:

```
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', ..., 'capitalize', 'lower', 'split', ...]
```

---

** Common use:**
Developers use `dir()` with `help()` to explore:

```python
import os
print(dir(os))
```

‚Üí Shows all functions and variables inside the `os` module.
