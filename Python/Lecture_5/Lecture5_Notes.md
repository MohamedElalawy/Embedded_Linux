##  **What is OOP in Python?**

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes code using **objects** ‚Äî reusable pieces that bundle **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods) together.

In Python, OOP is implemented mainly with **classes** and **objects**.

---

##  **What is a Class?**

A **class** is like a **blueprint** for creating **objects**.
An **object** is an **instance** of a class ‚Äî a real piece of data built from that blueprint.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Parts of Classes**

| Part                  | Description                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`__init__` method** | The **constructor**; runs when you create an object.              |
| **`self` keyword**    | Refers to the **current object** itself.                          |
| **Attributes**        | Variables that store data for each object.                        |
| **Methods**           | Functions defined inside the class that act on the object‚Äôs data. |

---

## üßµ **OOP Concepts in Python**

| Concept           | Meaning                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data (attributes) + behavior (methods) together.                            |
| **Inheritance**   | A class can **inherit** properties and methods from another class.                   |
| **Polymorphism**  | Different classes can have methods with the same name but different implementations. |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding internal details and exposing only necessary parts.                           |

---

## ‚úÖ **Inheritance Example**

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} vehicle started.")


# Car inherits from Vehicle
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        super().__init__(brand)  # Call parent constructor
        self.model = model

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model} car started.")


my_vehicle = Vehicle("Generic")
my_vehicle.start()  # Generic vehicle started.

my_car = Car("Honda", "Civic")
my_car.start()      # Honda Civic car started.
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Polymorphism Example**

```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

animals = [Dog(), Cat()]

for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())
# Woof!
# Meow!
```

---
# Constructor:


A **constructor** in Python is a special method that **runs automatically** when you **create an object** from a class.

Its job is to **initialize** the object‚Äôs **attributes**.

In Python, the constructor is always named:

```python
__init__(self, ...)
```

---

##  **Basic Example**

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # attribute
        self.age = age    # attribute

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")


# Create an object
p1 = Person("Alice", 30)

# Access attributes
print(p1.name)  # Alice
print(p1.age)   # 30

# Call method
p1.greet()      # Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

---

##  **Key Points**

| Feature        | Description                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`__init__`** | The constructor method ‚Äî runs when the object is created. |
| **`self`**     | Refers to the **current object** (instance).              |
| **Parameters** | You can pass arguments to initialize the object‚Äôs data.   |

---

##  **Default Values in Constructor**

You can set default values for parameters:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name="Unknown", age=0):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

p2 = Person()
print(p2.name)  # Unknown
print(p2.age)   # 0
```

---

# self

* `self` is **not a keyword** ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a **convention**, but almost always used.
* It represents the **instance** (the specific object) **itself**.
* It must be the **first parameter** of **instance methods** (like `__init__` or other methods).
* Through `self`, each object keeps track of **its own data**.

---

##  **Why is `self` needed?**

Imagine you have a class `Car` and you create two cars: `car1` and `car2`.
Each should store **its own brand, model, speed, etc.**

`self` makes sure the **method or attribute** works on the **right object**.

---

##  **How it works**

When you do:

```python
car1 = Car()
car2 = Car()
```

and then call:

```python
car1.drive()
car2.drive()
```

Internally, Python does:

```python
Car.drive(car1)
Car.drive(car2)
```

So `self` is **automatically passed** as the first argument!

---

##  **Example to show `self` clearly**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name   # attaches name to THIS object

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

dog1 = Dog("Max")
dog2 = Dog("Buddy")

dog1.bark()   # Max says woof!
dog2.bark()   # Buddy says woof!
```

‚û°Ô∏è Here:

* `self.name` is different for `dog1` and `dog2`.
* If you forget `self` ‚Üí all objects would **share the same variable**, which breaks OOP.

---

##  **`self` is required for instance methods**

```python
class Example:
    def say_hello():  # ‚ùå wrong ‚Äî missing self
        print("Hello!")

obj = Example()
# obj.say_hello()  # TypeError: missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'
```

‚û°Ô∏è The fix:

```python
class Example:
    def say_hello(self):  # ‚úÖ correct
        print("Hello!")

obj = Example()
obj.say_hello()  # Hello!
```

---

##  **`self` vs class variables**

Sometimes, you see:

```python
class Example:
    count = 0  # class variable

    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 10  # instance variable
```

* `count` belongs to the **class** (shared by all instances).
* `self.value` belongs to the **object**.

---

##  **Can you use a different name instead of `self`?**

Yes, technically:

```python
class Test:
    def hello(this):
        print("Hi!")

t = Test()
t.hello()  # Hi!
```

‚Ä¶but don‚Äôt do this ‚Äî `self` is the **standard** in Python.

---

##  **Where you see `self`**

| Where                              | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`__init__(self, ‚Ä¶)`**            | Constructor: binds attributes to this object.             |
| **Methods: `def method(self, ‚Ä¶)`** | Instance methods need to know *which* object called them. |
| **`self.attribute`**               | Create or access **object-specific** data.                |

---

##  **What about `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`**

* **Instance methods** ‚Üí `self`
* **Class methods** ‚Üí `cls` (the class itself, not the object)
* **Static methods** ‚Üí no `self` or `cls`

Example:

```python
class Example:
    def instance_method(self):
        print("I am an instance method")

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print("I am a class method")

    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("I am a static method")
```

---


# `str` vs `repr` 

---

##  Purpose

- **`str`** ‚Üí *User-friendly* representation  
- **`repr`** ‚Üí *Developer-friendly* (unambiguous) representation

- `str()` is meant to produce a **readable** string version of the object ‚Äî for end users.
- `repr()` is meant to produce an **unambiguous** representation that could, ideally, be used to recreate the object ‚Äî for developers and debugging.

---

##  How They Work

Python uses:
- `__str__` ‚Üí defines what `str()` returns
- `__repr__` ‚Üí defines what `repr()` returns

If `__str__` is **not** defined, `str()` falls back to `__repr__`.

---

##  When Are They Used Automatically?

- `print(obj)` ‚Üí uses `str(obj)` ‚Üí calls `__str__()`
- Typing `obj` in the Python REPL ‚Üí uses `repr(obj)` ‚Üí calls `__repr__()`

---

##  Example

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

    def __str__(self):
        return f'"{self.title}" by {self.author}'

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Book("{self.title}", "{self.author}")'

b = Book("1984", "George Orwell")

print(b)        # uses __str__: "1984" by George Orwell
print(str(b))   # same: "1984" by George Orwell
print(repr(b))  # uses __repr__: Book("1984", "George Orwell")

```

#  Inheritance

---

##  What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to **create a new class from an existing class**.

- The **existing class** is called the **Base class** (or **Parent class**, **Super class**).
- The **new class** is called the **Derived class** (or **Child class**, **Subclass**).

The derived class **inherits** attributes and methods from the base class and can also have its own or override the inherited ones.

---

##  Why Use Inheritance?

- **Code Reuse:** Avoid duplicating common code.
- **Extensibility:** Extend functionality of existing classes.
- **Hierarchy:** Represent real-world relationships.

Example: `Vehicle` ‚Üí `Car`, `Truck`, `Bike`.

---

##  Basic Syntax

```python
class BaseClass:
    # base class members
    pass

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # derived class members
    pass

```
---

## Simple Example

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

d = Dog()
d.speak()  # Inherited method
d.bark()   # Own method

```
---

## Overriding Methods

A derived class can override methods of the base class.
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):  # Overrides Animal's speak()
        print("Dog barks")

a = Animal()
a.speak()  # Animal speaks

d = Dog()
d.speak()  # Dog barks
```

---

## Using super()

super() is used to call methods from the base class inside the derived class.

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        super().speak()  # Call parent method
        print("Dog barks")

d = Dog()
d.speak()
# Output:
# Animal speaks
# Dog barks
```

---

## __init__ and Inheritance

When you override __init__ in the derived class, you often use super() to initialize the base class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, major):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.major = major

s = Student("Alice", "Physics")
print(s.name)   # Alice
print(s.major)  # Physics
```

---

## Types of Inheritance in Python


<img width="508" height="603" alt="17523816501214696195718096137765" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96ec0f6b-4732-4164-8363-eb43cdcc5ad9" />


## Single Inheritance

One child inherits from one parent.
```python
class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass
```

---

## Multiple Inheritance

A class inherits from multiple base classes.

```python
class A:
    pass

class B:
    pass

class C(A, B):
    pass
```

Python resolves conflicts using MRO (Method Resolution Order) ‚Äî determined by the C3 Linearization algorithm.


---

## Multilevel Inheritance

A class is derived from a derived class.

```python
class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class C(B):
    pass
```

---

## Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple classes inherit from the same base class.

```python
class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class C(A):
    pass

```
---

## Hybrid Inheritance

Combination of multiple types of inheritance.


---

## Checking Inheritance
```python
issubclass(Dog, Animal)  # True
isinstance(d, Dog)       # True
isinstance(d, Animal)    # True
```

---

## Method Resolution Order (MRO)

Python uses MRO to decide which parent to use first when there‚Äôs multiple inheritance.

You can check it with:
```python
print(Dog.mro())
# Or
print(Dog.__mro__)

```

# üìå Private Members in Python

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What are Private Members?

In Python, **private members** are class attributes (variables or methods) that **should not be accessed directly** from outside the class.

Unlike languages like C++ or Java, Python doesn‚Äôt have true private enforcement. Instead, it uses **name mangling** as a convention to discourage direct access.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Do You Define Them?

You define private members by prefixing their names with **two underscores (`__`)**:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_var = 42  # Private variable
        self._protected_var = 99 # Protected by convention (single underscore)

    def __private_method(self):
        print("This is a private method.")

    def public_method(self):
        print("Accessing private method:")
        self.__private_method()

```
---

3Ô∏è‚É£ How Does Name Mangling Work?

When you define __private_var, Python internally renames it to _ClassName__private_var.

So, you can still access it from outside (but you shouldn‚Äôt):
```python
obj = MyClass()

# ‚ùå Not recommended:
print(obj._MyClass__private_var)  # Accessing private variable directly

# ‚úÖ Recommended:
obj.public_method()  # Access via public method
```

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use Private Members?

‚úÖ Encapsulation: Hide internal details.

‚úÖ Control Access: Force interaction through public methods (e.g., getters/setters).

‚úÖ Prevent Accidental Modification: Not foolproof, but signals ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch this!‚Äù to other developers.



---

5Ô∏è‚É£ Note on Single Underscore _

A single underscore prefix (e.g., _var) means ‚Äúprotected‚Äù by convention.

It signals: ‚ÄúThis is internal, handle with care!‚Äù

However, Python does not mangle names with a single underscore, so it‚Äôs purely a developer agreement.


---


üìå Operator Overloading in Python

‚úÖ What is Operator Overloading?

Operator overloading lets you define how operators like +, -, *, == behave for your custom objects.

Example:

3 + 5 is really int.__add__(3, 5)

a + b for your class will call a.__add__(b) if you define it



---

‚úÖ Why Use Operator Overloading?

To make custom classes behave naturally, for example:
```python

Vector(1, 2) + Vector(3, 4)  # ‚Üí Vector(4, 6)
MyClass1 == MyClass2         # ‚Üí custom comparison logic
```

---

‚úÖ How to Overload Operators?

You override special methods (__add__, __eq__, __lt__ etc.).

Example: Overload + for a Vector class
```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

v1 = Vector(2, 4)
v2 = Vector(5, -2)
v3 = v1 + v2  # calls v1.__add__(v2)

print(v3)  # Output: Vector(7, 2)

```
---

‚úÖ Common Operator Overloading Methods

Operator	Special Method

+	__add__(self, other)
-	__sub__(self, other)
*	__mul__(self, other)
/	__truediv__(self, other)
//	__floordiv__(self, other)
%	__mod__(self, other)
**	__pow__(self, other)
==	__eq__(self, other)
!=	__ne__(self, other)
<	__lt__(self, other)
<=	__le__(self, other)
>	__gt__(self, other)
>=	__ge__(self, other)
str()	__str__(self)
repr()	__repr__(self)



---

‚úÖ Reverse and In-place Operators

__radd__(self, other) ‚Üí Reverse add. If a + b calls a.__add__(b) and it returns NotImplemented, Python calls b.__radd__(a).

__iadd__(self, other) ‚Üí In-place add (+=). If not defined, Python falls back to __add__.



---

‚úÖ Notes

Usually, __add__ should return a new instance, not modify self.

For immutable types, never change the original object.

You can overload comparison, arithmetic, and other operators to make your class intuitive.



---

‚úÖ Example: Equality Overloading
```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, pages):
        self.title = title
        self.pages = pages

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.title == other.title and self.pages == other.pages

b1 = Book("Python", 300)
b2 = Book("Python", 300)
print(b1 == b2)  # True

```
---


# Functors 

In general programming, a **functor** is:

> An object that can be called like a function.

In **Python**, this means:
- A functor is any object that implements the special method `__call__()`.
- This allows you to use `obj()` syntax, just like calling a regular function.

---

## How to Create a Functor in Python

You define a class with a `__call__` method:

```python
class Adder:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __call__(self, x):
        return self.value + x

# Create a functor instance
add_five = Adder(5)

print(add_five(10))  # Output: 15
```

---

# Static Methods 

A **static method** in Python is:
- A method that belongs to a class but **does not access or modify class or instance data**.
- It behaves just like a regular function but is **grouped logically inside the class‚Äôs namespace**.

---

## When to Use Static Methods

Use a static method when:
- You want to put a utility function **inside a class** for **logical grouping**.
- The function **doesn‚Äôt need access** to `self` (the instance) or `cls` (the class).

---

## How to Define a Static Method

You use the `@staticmethod` decorator.

**Example:**

```python
class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

# Call the static method
result = MathUtils.add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 12

```
---

How Static Methods Work

No self parameter.

No cls parameter.

They do not modify class state or instance state.

---

# import

When you import a module in Python, you don‚Äôt create an ‚Äúinstance‚Äù like you do when you instantiate a class.
Instead, you are loading a module object into memory (if it‚Äôs not already loaded), and you get a reference to that module.


---

‚úÖ What really happens when you import?

1. Python finds the module file (.py) using the sys.path.


2. If the module has not been loaded yet, Python:

Compiles it to bytecode (if needed).

Executes its code once to create a module object.

Caches that module object in sys.modules.



3. If you import the same module again:

Python does not run the code again.

It just gives you a reference to the same module object.

---

‚úÖ So is a module an instance?

Technically, a module is an object of type module.
```python
import math
print(type(math))  # <class 'module'>
```
But it‚Äôs not an instance of a user-defined class ‚Äî it‚Äôs a singleton object created by the Python runtime.



---

‚úÖ Example
```python
# file: mymodule.py
print("Hello, I am loaded!")

x = 5

# file: main.py
import mymodule  # Prints: Hello, I am loaded!
import mymodule  # Does not print again ‚Äî already loaded.
```

---

‚úÖ Where is the module stored?

The module object is cached in sys.modules:

import sys
import math

print(sys.modules['math'])  # <module 'math' (built-in)>

---

‚úÖ Is a module like a singleton?

Yes ‚Äî you can think of a module as a singleton object.
It has attributes (variables, functions, classes) that you can access.


---
