The **difference between an interpreter and a compiler** lies in **how they translate and execute code** written in a programming language like Python, C, or Java.

### üîÅ Interpreter

* **Definition**: Translates and executes code **line by line**.
* **Execution**: Runs the program **directly** without creating a separate file.
* **Speed**: Slower because it translates code on the fly.
* **Error Handling**: Stops at the **first error** it encounters.
* **Examples**:

  * Python
  * JavaScript
  * Ruby

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compiler

* **Definition**: Translates the **entire program** into machine code **before** running it.
* **Execution**: Produces a separate **executable file** (e.g., `.exe`).
* **Speed**: Faster at runtime since it's already translated.
* **Error Handling**: Shows **all errors** at once during compilation.
* **Examples**:

  * C
  * C++
  * Rust

### Summary Table

| Feature            | Interpreter            | Compiler              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Translation method | Line by line           | Whole program at once |
| Output             | No file, just executes | Creates executable    |
| Speed              | Slower                 | Faster                |
| Error handling     | One at a time          | All at once           |
| Examples           | Python, JS             | C, C++                |
