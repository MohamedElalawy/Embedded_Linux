# `PyObject` and `PyVarObject`:
In **CPython** (the reference implementation of Python), `PyObject` and `PyVarObject` are C **structs** used in the C API for implementing Python objects.

---

### üìå `PyObject`

**Definition (simplified):**

```c
typedef struct _object {
    Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;
    struct _typeobject *ob_type;
} PyObject;
```

‚úÖ **Key points:**

* It‚Äôs the **base type** for *all* Python objects.
* `ob_refcnt`: the **reference count** for memory management (Python uses reference counting for garbage collection).
* `ob_type`: pointer to the type object that describes what type it is (e.g., int, list, custom class).

Any object (integer, list, function, module, etc.) has this header.

---

### üìå `PyVarObject`

**Definition (simplified):**

```c
typedef struct {
    PyObject ob_base;
    Py_ssize_t ob_size;
} PyVarObject;
```

‚úÖ **Key points:**

* It **extends** `PyObject`.
* `ob_size`: stores the size for **variable-sized** objects (like lists, tuples, strings, dicts).
* Examples: `PyListObject`, `PyTupleObject` ‚Äî both start with `PyVarObject`.

So:

* `PyObject` ‚Üí for *fixed-size* objects.
* `PyVarObject` ‚Üí for *variable-size* objects (where the size is stored in `ob_size`).

### üìö Example:

* An `int` ‚Üí `PyObject`
* A `list` ‚Üí `PyVarObject`

## üìå 1Ô∏è‚É£ Where does **fragmentation** come in?

When you do:

```py
x = [1, 2, 3]
for i in range(1000000):
    x.append(i)
```

here we are making the **list grow** dynamically.

In CPython, a list is implemented like a **dynamic array**:

* It uses a contiguous block of memory to store **pointers** to its elements.
* When you `append` and the array is full, it **allocates a bigger block**, copies the old elements, and frees the old block.

This **dynamic resizing** can cause **heap fragmentation**:

* The allocator (`pymalloc` in CPython) tries to find a big enough block.
* If the memory is fragmented, there may be many small free blocks but not enough **contiguous** space.
* So, reallocating large lists repeatedly can contribute to fragmentation in the C heap.

**However**: The list object itself (`PyListObject`) stays the **same object** ‚Äî its `id()` does not change because the `PyListObject` struct is still at the same address ‚Äî only its **`ob_item` array** is reallocated behind the scenes.

---

## üìå 2Ô∏è‚É£ Where do `PyObject` and `PyVarObject` come in?

**How Python represents your list:**

```c
typedef struct {
    PyVarObject ob_base;  // has PyObject header + ob_size
    PyObject **ob_item;   // pointer to C array of PyObject* (elements)
    Py_ssize_t allocated; // how big the array currently is
} PyListObject;
```

‚úÖ **Key:**

* The `PyListObject` is a `PyVarObject` ‚Üí it holds `ob_size` for the current length.
* Its **payload** (`ob_item` ‚Äî the array of pointers) is managed separately on the C heap.
* When you `append`, Python:

  1. Checks if `ob_size < allocated`.
  2. If yes, just puts the new pointer in `ob_item`.
  3. If no, allocates a bigger array (typically with over-allocation for amortized O(1) appends).

---

## üìå 3Ô∏è‚É£ What about the `int` inside the list?

Each `x[0]` is a pointer to a `PyLongObject`:

```c
typedef struct {
    PyObject ob_base;  // header
    Py_ssize_t ob_size; // number of digits (variable size)
    digit ob_digit[1];  // flexible array member for the actual digits
} PyLongObject;
```

So an integer can actually be a `PyVarObject` too (for large ints) ‚Äî but small integers like `1` use a special single-digit representation, and CPython **interns** them for performance.

This is why `id(x[0])` never changes:

* The **`1`** lives at a stable address in the Python small int cache.
* Your list just holds a **pointer** to it.

---

## ‚úÖ Putting it all together:

* Your list `x` ‚Üí a `PyVarObject` that manages a **variable-length array**.
* The `int` inside ‚Üí a (small) `PyLongObject` (which is itself a `PyVarObject` when large).
* Fragmentation ‚Üí happens when `ob_item` needs bigger space and the memory allocator struggles to find contiguous free blocks.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è So:

* `PyObject` gives **reference counting** and **type info**.
* `PyVarObject` adds **variable size** info (`ob_size`).
* Fragmentation is about the C heap: when growing lists, the pointers may move internally, but the **Python object** stays stable from the Python code‚Äôs point of view.

---

## üîë Bottom line for the script:

 `id(x[0])` checks the **ID of the `1`** ‚Äî which never changes.
But behind the scenes:

* The list‚Äôs internal `ob_item` pointer may be **reallocated** many times ‚Üí this is where fragmentation risk lies.
* Python‚Äôs `pymalloc` + the OS heap allocator manage this complexity for you.

---
üîë **Note:**
`id(x[0])` won‚Äôt change just by `append()`ing to the list, because `1` is immutable and interned in CPython.

It would only change if **you explicitly overwrite** `x[0]` with a different object:

```py
x[0] = 5  # Now id(x[0]) changes!
```
