Excellent — this is a **very important distinction** in C++.
Let’s go through it carefully 👇

---

## 🧩 1. When a method is **defined inside** the class

Example:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    void test() { std::cout << "Inside class definition\n"; }
};
```

✅ **This version is automatically `inline`.**

That’s because, according to the C++ standard:

> Any member function that is defined *inside the class definition* is implicitly declared as `inline`.

So, the compiler treats it as:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    inline void test() { std::cout << "Inside class definition\n"; }
};
```

This allows you to place the class definition (and its functions) in a **header file** without causing “multiple definition” errors when included in multiple `.cpp` files.

---

## 🧩 2. When a method is **declared inside** but **defined outside** the class

<img width="1303" height="671" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ed82cc0-1a1b-4579-afd3-8711207fe84b" />


🚫 **This version is *not* automatically inline.**

Now, the compiler no longer assumes it’s `inline`, because:

* The definition is *separate* from the class body.
* Only functions defined *inside* the class body get that implicit `inline` behavior.

So here, `Car::test()` is a **normal function**, not an inline one.

---

## 🧠 3. If you still want it inline

You can explicitly mark it as `inline` yourself:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    void test();
};

inline void Car::test() {
    std::cout << "Defined outside but marked inline\n";
}
```

Now the compiler treats it the same way as if it were defined inside the class — it can be inlined, and multiple definitions across translation units are allowed.

---

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Definition style                        | Example                                  | Implicitly inline? | Notes                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Defined **inside** class                | `void test(){...}`                       | ✅ Yes              | Automatic `inline`                    |
| Declared inside, defined **outside**    | `void test();` + `void Car::test(){...}` | ❌ No               | Must add `inline` manually            |
| Defined outside **with inline keyword** | `inline void Car::test(){...}`           | ✅ Yes              | Equivalent to inside-class definition |

---

### 💬 In short

> A member function is only **implicitly inline** if it’s **defined inside** the class body.
> If you define it **outside**, you must explicitly write `inline` if you want the same behavior.

### 🧠 What it means

#### 1. `constexpr` or `consteval` functions are **implicitly inline**

When you write:

```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) { return x * x; }
```

you don’t need to also write `inline`.
Because `constexpr` already **implies** `inline`.

So this:

```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) { return x * x; }
```

is **equivalent to**:

```cpp
inline constexpr int square(int x) { return x * x; }
```

---

#### 2. Why?

Because `constexpr` functions are often defined in **header files**, and the compiler must allow multiple identical definitions of them across translation units — the same reason we need `inline`.

If `constexpr` didn’t imply `inline`, you’d get “multiple definition” linker errors whenever you included the same header in several `.cpp` files.

---

#### 3. The same applies to `consteval` (since C++20)

`consteval` means the function **must** be evaluated at compile-time.
It also gets the same implicit `inline` behavior.

Example:

```cpp
consteval int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
```

This is treated as:

```cpp
inline consteval int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
```

---

#### 4. Deleted functions are also implicitly inline

Example:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    Car(const Car&) = delete;
};
```

Even though `= delete;` means the function can’t be used,
the standard makes it **implicitly inline**, so that the “deleted” declaration can safely appear in multiple translation units (again, usually through header inclusion).

---

| Function Type                                    | Implicitly `inline`? | Why                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Defined inside a class                           | ✅ Yes                | Class member rule                                |
| Declared `constexpr`                             | ✅ Yes                | Must be usable in headers & constant expressions |
| Declared `consteval` (C++20+)                    | ✅ Yes                | Compile-time only function                       |
| Declared `= delete`                              | ✅ Yes                | Safe to repeat across translation units          |
| Declared/defined outside class (normal function) | ❌ No                 | Needs `inline` explicitly                        |

## 🧩 What is a Constructor?

A **constructor** is a **special function** inside a class that’s automatically called when you **create an object** of that class.

Its main job is to **initialize** the object — that is, set up its data members and prepare it for use.

---

### 🧠 Key facts about constructors

* The constructor’s **name is the same as the class name**.
* It **has no return type** (not even `void`).
* It can be **overloaded** (you can have multiple constructors with different parameters).
* It’s called **automatically** when you create an object.

Example:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    Car() { // Constructor
        std::cout << "Car object created!\n";
    }
};
```

When you write:

```cpp
Car myCar;
```

→ The constructor `Car()` is automatically called.

---

## ⚙️ Types of Constructors

There are **5 main types** of constructors in C++.

---

### 1️⃣ **Default Constructor**

* Takes **no parameters**.
* Automatically created by the compiler if you don’t define any constructor yourself.

Example:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    Car() {
        std::cout << "Default constructor called\n";
    }
};
```

If you don’t define it, the compiler implicitly provides:

```cpp
Car() = default;
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Parameterized Constructor**

* Takes **arguments**.
* Used to initialize objects with specific values.

Example:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;
    int year;

    Car(std::string b, int y) {
        brand = b;
        year = y;
    }
};
```

Usage:

```cpp
Car c1("Audi", 2024);
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Copy Constructor**

* Used when **creating a new object from an existing one** of the same type.
* The syntax is:

  ```cpp
  ClassName (const ClassName &obj)
  ```

Example:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;

    Car(std::string b) : brand(b) {}
    Car(const Car &c) { // Copy constructor
        brand = c.brand;
    }
};
```

Usage:

```cpp
Car c1("BMW");
Car c2 = c1; // Calls copy constructor
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Move Constructor** (C++11 and later)

* Used to transfer (move) resources from one object to another **instead of copying**.
* Signature:

  ```cpp
  ClassName(ClassName &&obj)
  ```

Example:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;

    Car(std::string b) : brand(std::move(b)) {}
    Car(Car &&c) noexcept { // Move constructor
        brand = std::move(c.brand);
    }
};
```

Usage:

```cpp
Car c1("Tesla");
Car c2 = std::move(c1); // Move constructor called
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Copy Elision / Compiler-Generated Constructor**

* The compiler may **omit** copy or move operations for optimization (called *copy elision*).
* You’ll often see this in return statements:

  ```cpp
  return Car("BMW"); // The temporary is constructed directly
  ```

---

### Bonus: **Destructor** (not a constructor but related)

When the object’s lifetime ends, the **destructor** is automatically called to clean up:

```cpp
~Car() {
    std::cout << "Car destroyed\n";
}
```

---

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Type                      | Syntax                 | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Default Constructor       | `Car()`                | Initializes object with default values    |
| Parameterized Constructor | `Car(int a, string b)` | Initializes object with specific values   |
| Copy Constructor          | `Car(const Car &obj)`  | Creates copy of another object            |
| Move Constructor          | `Car(Car &&obj)`       | Transfers resources instead of copying    |
| Implicit / Defaulted      | `Car() = default;`     | Compiler-generated version if not defined |

---

## 🧩 What is `this`?

In C++, **`this`** is a **special pointer** that exists inside **all non-static member functions** of a class.

It **points to the object** that **called** the function.

---

### 🧠 Think of it like this:

When you have an object calling a method:

```cpp
Car audi;
audi.start();
```

Inside the `start()` function, the compiler secretly passes a hidden pointer — the **address of `audi`** — so that the function knows *which object’s data it’s working on*.

That pointer is named `this`.

---

### 🔹 Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int year;

    Car(string b, int y) {
        // "this" points to the object being constructed
        this->brand = b;
        this->year = y;
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "Brand: " << this->brand << ", Year: " << this->year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car c1("BMW", 2024);
    c1.show();
}
```

#### Output:

```
Brand: BMW, Year: 2024
```

Here:

* Inside the constructor, `this->brand` refers to the **brand member** of the current object (`c1`).
* `this` is a pointer to `c1`.

---

### 🧩 Why use `this`?

It’s especially useful when:

1. **Parameter names are the same as member names:**

   ```cpp
   class Car {
       string brand;
   public:
       Car(string brand) {
           this->brand = brand; // disambiguates between member and parameter
       }
   };
   ```

   Without `this->`, the compiler would think both refer to the parameter.

---

2. **Returning the current object**

   ```cpp
   class Car {
       int speed;
   public:
       Car(int s) : speed(s) {}
       Car& setSpeed(int s) {
           this->speed = s;
           return *this; // return the object itself
       }
   };
   ```

   Then you can chain calls:

   ```cpp
   Car c(100);
   c.setSpeed(120).setSpeed(150); // method chaining
   ```

---

3. **Passing the current object to another function**

   ```cpp
   void printCar(const Car* c);

   class Car {
   public:
       void show() {
           printCar(this); // pass pointer to current object
       }
   };
   ```

---

| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type             | `this` is a **pointer** (e.g., `Car* this` inside class `Car`) |
| Scope            | Available in **non-static member functions only**              |
| Static functions | ❌ Cannot use `this`, since they are not tied to any object     |
| Const functions  | The type becomes `const Car* this`                             |

Example:

```cpp
void show() const {
    // here, "this" is of type "const Car*"
}
